# Faculty Intelligence Dashboard Design

## 1. Overview
The Faculty Intelligence Dashboard is the institutional-facing web application of the Agentic AI platform. While the ReAct Agent directly handles students via micro-warnings and GenAI payloads, the dashboard aggregates this telemetry to provide educators, course designers, and administrators with macro-level insights.

## 2. Dashboard Layout Structure
The frontend UI is divided into 4 primary views:

1. **At-Risk Command Center (The Roster)**
    - Heatmap of currently active students sorted by `risk_score` $P(Drop)$.
    - Columns for: Student ID, Primary Dropout Type, Last Intervention, Expected Dropout Horizon ($T_d$).
2. **Pedagogical Analytics (The Course Health)**
    - *Course Difficulty Heatmap*: Time-spent vs Accuracy across all modules.
    - *Topic-Level Failure Clustering*: Tags (e.g., "Module 4: Pointers") where $>30\%$ of the cohort triggers "Conceptual Confusion".
    - *Syllabus Improvement Suggestions*: Auto-generated by analyzing the ReAct agent's generated Revision Notes.
3. **Intervention Efficacy Tracker (The RL Monitor)**
    - Dashboard mapping the historical Contextual Bandit success rates.
    - Charts showing which strategies (e.g., "Schedule Restructure") work best for which Dropout Archetypes (e.g., "Burnout").
4. **Ethical AI & Compliance Monitor**
    - High-level demographic parity parity dials (Gender, SES).
    - False-Positive Alert tracking.
    - Over-Intervention (Fatigue) incidence rates.

## 3. Backend API Endpoints (FastAPI structure)

- `GET /api/v1/faculty/roster/at-risk`
   Returns the paginated list of high-risk students and their active classification blocks.
- `GET /api/v1/faculty/course-health/{course_id}`
   Aggregates the course intelligence module's findings.
- `GET /api/v1/faculty/interventions/efficacy`
   Returns the summary statistics from the Intervention Memory system.
- `GET /api/v1/faculty/ethics/summary`
   Queries the `EthicalMonitor` logs to output bias and transparency metrics.

## 4. Aggregation Logic
The backend runs a CRON job (or equivalent async task) every 24 hours that sweeps the SQL tables:
1. `intervention_memory`: Averages `delta_risk_reduction` grouped by `strategy_used` and `dropout_type` to build the Efficacy Tracker.
2. `student_behavior_logs`: Counts frequency of `Conceptual Confusion` warnings tied to specific `module_id`s to find syllabus bottlenecks.

## 5. Example JSON Response (`GET /api/v1/faculty/course-health/CS101`)
